Her husband works as a teacher but also makes and sells guitars. The couple owns the property title under both their names. Mrs. Flores buys her beer stock from her sister-in-law, who has the supplier code, and buys each box for 63.30 soles although she sells each unit for 78 soles and each box for 650 soles. Mrs. Flores has been living in the area for 27 years and is well known by her neighbors, who often ask her to cook them paus, which she sells for 33 pesos per kilo. She spends 120 pesos a month on food for her 35 animals, who she raises to sell. She also helps her neighbors out by giving them leftover food for their animals. Her husband works in Tambo Grande but also sells guitars that he makes himself. A woman is discussing business opportunities with a bank representative. She is interested in investing in a house made of noble materials to rent it out in the future, but she is advised to invest in a business instead since it would grant her a faster profit. The bank offers her the possibility of buying debt portfolios from other clients and purchasing debt purchases for 4000 soles with the possibility of obtaining 2000 soles in capital to invest in her business. She would need to pay back the debt purchases in order to withdraw the difference. The bank offers her favorable conditions due to her good previous collaboration with Iv√°n, which is linked to punctuality."]
