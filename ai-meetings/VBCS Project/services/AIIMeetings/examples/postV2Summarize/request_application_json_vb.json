"documents": ["Indias LGBTQ population saw few of its concerns addressed ahead of the countrys general elections. In 2018 the Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality, scrapping a colonial-era law in a move the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) takes credit for.  But last year, the Supreme Court of India ruled against a petition to legalize same-sex marriage, and activists say LGBTQ people in India continue to face discrimination and abuse.  What the ruling party says: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), expected to secure another five years in power, has failed to adequately address this community on the campaign trail. In its manifesto, it promised to expand India's network of shelters for transgender people and promised to give them national ID cards. But transgender activists say the BJP government claims to provide rights for transgender people, but it has made it hard for them to live as equals in India.In parliament, 151 members have been vocal on LGBTQ issues, and fewer than 20 of these were from the BJP, according to PinkList, a national archive of politicians supporting LGBTQ rights. What the opposition says: the Indian National Congress has said in its manifesto that it would legalize civil unions between LGBTQ couples if elected. "]
