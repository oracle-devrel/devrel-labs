"India's LGBTQ+ population has expressed disappointment at the lack of attention their concerns received ahead of the country's general elections. While the Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality in 2018, the court recently ruled against legalizing same-sex marriage, and activists argue that discrimination and abuse against LGBTQ+ individuals persist. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), expected to remain in power, has been criticized for not doing enough to support the community during their campaign, despite promises to expand transgender shelters and provide national ID cards. The opposition Indian National Congress has pledged to legalize civil unions for LGBTQ+ couples if elected."
