Language detection and text classification capabilities are shown using pre-trained models. The named entity recognition capability can extract entities like organization names, product names, and geographic locations. The key phrase extraction capability identifies important terms and can be used to generate tags for documents. The sentiment analysis capability scores the sentiment of a text, identifying positive or negative sentiments. Custom models can be created to detect entities of interest. The Language Service also enables text translation for both plain and HTML text. Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding this demonstration? The text analysis features of Oracle Cloud Interface (OCI) include sentiment analysis, which determines how positive or negative a text is, and named entity recognition, which identifies entities such as people, places, and things. These features can be used to analyze customer feedback and survey results to track product and feature performance and drive improvements. The interface also has a text translation feature that can translate text from one language to another, while retaining HTML formatting. Additionally, OCI can identify and mask personal identifiable information in text. OCI also enables you to create custom models for text classification, which can be tailored to your specific needs. You can train these models on your own dataset and they will perform better on classification tasks specific to your domain compared to pre-trained models. Overall, OCI's text analysis capabilities can help businesses and developers gain valuable insights from text data and make informed decisions. Would you like help with anything else regarding OCI, or text analysis? Companies may require specific language models for their industry or use case, which cannot be covered by general models. To train a custom language model, companies must first prepare a training dataset specific to their use case. For a custom text classification model, this comes in the form of a CSV file, with one column containing the text to be classified and another column containing the labels or categories to which the text should be classified. Once the dataset is prepared, it needs to be uploaded to object storage. Then, a project must be created in the OCI Language Console, followed by the creation of a text classification model. The training data for the model should be selected from object storage, and the model should be named. After reviewing the training details, the model will begin training, and users can monitor its progress. Once training is complete, users can review metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to determine if the model is ready for production. If the model is accurate enough, a model endpoint is created, and the model is ready to run inference. For example, the model can categorize an email requesting a refund for a cancelled flight as a cancellation and predict that the customer is asking for a refund, identifying two categories accurately. Companies can use the Object Storage, Data Labelling Service, and Language Services available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to create and run a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify and extract specific data points from offer letters, such as position names, hire names, and hiring managers. After labelling the training data set using the Data Labelling Service, upload it to Object Storage and create the NER model within the Language Service. You can then create a model endpoint and use the Text Classification feature to analyse and extract information from new documents. Ready-to-use models are available through the Language Service for text analysis and classification, but custom models can also be created without prior machine learning or data science experience. The service also provides translation APIs for text and HTML content. Businesses can utilise OCI's Language Service to automate the extraction of important data from documents such as offer letters, minimising manual labour and reducing the risk of errors. This summary provides an overview of how to use OCI's Language Service to create an NER model for processing offer letters and extracting relevant data points. It also highlights the benefits of using ready-to-use models and translation APIs within the Language Service"         }
