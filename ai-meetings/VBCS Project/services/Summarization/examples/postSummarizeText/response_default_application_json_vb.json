    "summary": "A year on from the 28th February coup attempt in Spain, the country is gearing up for European elections while the government continues to push through controversial legislation, such as the Amnesty Law, despite widespread opposition and protests. Against this backdrop, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, Mayor of Madrid and leader of the conservative People's Party (PP), reflects on the success of the PP's 20,000-strong demonstration in the capital on Sunday, believing it demonstrates the party's ability to mobilize people as well as highlighting discontent with the government and Pedro Sánchez. He also suggests the high attendance figure, whether the true number was 20,000 or 80,000, demonstrates the strength of feeling among Spaniards ahead of important European elections.",
